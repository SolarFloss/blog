            <span class="post-text">Alexa Who? For those of you who don’t know, Amazon sells a product known as the Echo/Echo Dot. It is essentially an in-home virtual assistant like Google Assistant or Siri. The name of the actual assistant in this case is Alexa. I happen to own an Echo Dot, which I mainly use to check the weather or set alarms. What makes these assistants interesting is the addition of skills. Skills are essentially apps that anyone can make and put on a online marketplace. I don’t think they can be sold, but I couldn’t think of a better word.

Happy late thanksgiving to those of you that celebrate Thanksgiving. Although I was pretty busy, I finally finished up work for my client! I did my second invoice ever so that’s exciting. When we were talking on the phone he asked me “How will you charge me for any future changes to the site?”. At the time I wasn’t really sure how I’d go about doing that so I told him I’d get back to...</span><a href="/blog/future-work/"><b>more</b></a>

Because of this I couldn’t squeeze in a post last week! I’m still insanely busy, but I refuse to go two weeks in a row without any sort of post. This post will be relatively short, but I need to get in a posting groove if I want to do this long term. Charging Clients I’ve been doing a lot of reading on Medium.com and /r/freelance on Reddit and I’ve heard quite a few things about...</span><a href="/blog/charging-clients/"><b>more</b></a>

            <span class="post-text">Some New Changes! Hello again! Since last week, I’ve made quite a number of changes to the blog. One of which is the addition of Disqus for commenting, so now you all can leave feedback directly on the site! The second change is the addition of ads. Now I know what you’re thinking. “Ads suck you sellout!”. I agree with one out of those two statements. Ads do in fact suck, but I like to consider myself better than a sellout to be honest. Before you leave my blog because you are disappointed in my choices let me explain why...</span><a href="/blog/blog-updates/"><b>more</b></a>

            <span class="post-text">Hello Everyone! Thank you for visiting my ad page! Becuase ads are generally intrusive and ugly, I decided to make a post with ads and treat it as my support page. I haven’t seen anyone do anything like this, and that’s probably because it’s not really effective. The idea in my head is to leave a link to this page at the end of every post, and when you click it you will be taken to this page which has an ad or two on it. This way the ads are shown by choice! Does This Work? My guess is...</span><a href="/blog/support-with-google/"><b>more</b></a>

All of my emails generally follow the same pattern: Hello, My name is Nicholas Morris and I am a web developer and designer. I have been looking at local and semi-local businesses that have websites that need a redesign, and I noticed your site, and I think that your site could use a new look.

That, or you could just click here. I’d recommend reading the post though! I Did It! Kinda..

I’ve been telling myself for the past several months to really polish my skills and then start making that cold hard cash on UpWork. I had been putting that off for so long, but I had finally decided to just jump right in. I made my account, set up my personal profile, and made a cheeky description of myself.
