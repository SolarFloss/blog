# Alexa Who?

For those of you who don't know, Amazon sells a product known as the [Echo/Echo Dot](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Damazon-devices&field-keywords=echo). It is essentially an in-home virtual assistant like Google Assistant or Siri. The name of the actual assistant in this case is Alexa. I happen to own an Echo Dot, which I mainly use to check the weather or set alarms. What makes these assistants interesting is the addition of skills. Skills are essentially apps that anyone can make and put on a online marketplace. I don't think they can be sold, but I couldn't think of a better word.

# What Kinds of Skills Are There?

You can head over to [Amazon's Skill page](https://www.amazon.com/b?node=13727921011) to get a list of popular skills, the most popular one being Jeopardy. I have not personally used this skill before but I am aware that it is the most popular. It runs as you would think any Jeopardy game works where there are questions asked, and they are answered in the format of "What is...".

# What's Significant About All of This?

I recently learned that Amazon does a sort of competition or promotion where if you make an Alexa Skill and it gets 100 unique enables (downloads), you get a free Echo Dot. Even if you do not get 100 unique enables, you will get some sort of merch, this month's merch being a hoodie. The only reason I bought my Echo Dot was to make cool skills, but I haven't really gotten around to it, but with some sort of motivation, I think I will be able to pull something off. Even if I don't get 100 unique enables I will be glad that I finished a skill, and that I will be getting a new hoodie!

# My Ideas

I don't want to go into too many specifics as to what my ideas are, but I'll give a brief run down of two ideas that I've had:

## Time Tracker

I had this idea a couple weeks ago, and it has the potential to solve a problem that I actually have. The basic premise of the skill is to keep track of certain tasks. So I could tell it that I am working on homework, and it would start keeping track of the amount of time I have been doing homework for. I could then repeat this for several activities throughout the day. If I leave my house to go to the gym, I could tell Alexa that I am going to the gym. This would help me when working for a client, where I can tell Alexa to record how many hours I've been doing work for a client so I can then charge accurately.

## A 'Foolproof' Alarm

I use my Echo Dot as a morning alarm clock most morning, and all I have to do to turn it off is say "Alexa, stop". The problem is that I quickly fall back asleep. So my solution would be to have Alexa not turn off the alarm until I press a button on the actual device which is on the opposite side of my room. I could expand on this by having users do other active tasks. I am aware that there are already mobile apps that do just this, but I think it would be nice to make a solution of my own.


# Time Crunch

Unfortunately, I have finals this week and next week so I won't really be able to get started on this for the next two weeks. That gives me very little time to get 100 unique enables, but I'm still up for the challenge. If time because too much of an issue I'll go with my easiest, but most effective idea. Being that I have an entire month to get this finished I will most likely be making a post about my experience along the way, so you should look forward to that. If anyone else decides to participate, I wish you luck!
