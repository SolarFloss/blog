# How's it Going?

Hey everyone! Last week was Thanksgiving so I was busy with other stuff to write a post, so I apologize for that. Happy late thanksgiving to those of you that celebrate Thanksgiving. Although I was pretty busy, I finally finished up work for my client! I did my second invoice ever so that's exciting. When we were talking on the phone he asked me "How will you charge me for any future changes to the site?". At the time I wasn't really sure how I'd go about doing that so I told him I'd get back to him on that, but I still dono't really have a clue.

Since I didn't install a CMS on the site, any changes that have to be made, will be coded in by me. When I first started making the site I decided to not go with a CMS because it felt like more work than what was needed for such a small site (that and I don't know how to set one up yet). For the most part I stand by that notion, but if he starts consistently asking for updates, I'll consider setting one up.

In regards to a payment model I thought about picking a hourly rate to go by and stick with it. I think that this is the best way to go about this. To get some feedback on that idea I decided to ask the question on [/r/freelance](https://reddit.com/r/freelance), but for some reason the thread was locked. I'm willing to say that I probably broke a rule or something somewhere, but I didn't get a reason for the thread being locked so that's unfortunate. Because of that I didn't get any more insight as to what to charge. so I'll be sticking with an hourly rate. Like I said in my previous post, I feel that hourly rates are very flexible and scalable.

# Looking Back

Now that I am basically done with my first client, I can look back and think about what I learned throughout this process.

## Life Gets in the Way

First and foremost, this whole process takes a lot longer than what I initially expected. I knew it wouldn't be a walk in the part, but I expected to be done in about one or two weeks. That was definitely not the case. It's not that I was working especially slow, but life gets in the way. 

## Web Development is a Disaster

Now I already knew this was the case, but I have never had to make a site for someone and be positive that it works everywhere else. My main browser is Opera, which is based off of Chrome so when checking the site on those sites, everything looked fine. I could say the same thing for firefox, but not for Safari. I ran into several problems that stemmed from both the mobile and desktop versions of safari. I own an Android device, and have a laptop that runs on Ubuntu Linux, so testing safari was a hassle. I ended up using all 60 minutes of the [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com) free trial to get the website to function correctly on mobile and desktop Safari. In the future I'll have to either buy a full plan with them ($99/month billed annually) or buy cheap devices. I made a post on twitter asking for someone's used iPod touch.

## Restrictions are Less Than Ideal

This is pretty straightforward but I hadn't really considered this before I started. When making a fake site or my portfolio I could do whatever I wanted, and to me, it would look good because it is what I intended to make. For a client I have to make what is in their head. When I show them the final product, hopefully they like it, but it doens't look as good as it can be in my eyes, but that's mostly because it isn't what I would prefer. I'm sure there is a nice balance somewhere that I'll reach at some point, but for now I'll have to work on it. I also need to focus on what I'm offering to the client. I think that being able to turn the client's thoughts into reality is a good talking point


# Moving Forward

For the most part this has been a good experience and I'm looking forward to my next client. I do hope that my future clients will be as flexible as the this one. I am still new to all of this, and he seemed to understand this and level with me in most situations. It's nice to know that I've come pretty far though, and that it can only get better if I keep up this pace. Anyway, thanks for stopping by and listening to what I have to say. If you have any questions or comments let me know on my various social media accounts, or go ahead and leave a comment here. I hope to see you again next time!
