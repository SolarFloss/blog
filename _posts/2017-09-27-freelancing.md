# The Inital Grind
Ever since putting up this blog I have been pressuring myself to actually start getting clients. That's way easier said than done though. I've been telling myself for the past several months to really polish my skills and then start making that cold hard cash on [UpWork][upwork]. I had been putting that off for so long, but I had finally decided to just jump right in. I made my account, set up my personal profile, and made a cheeky description of myself. I thought I was golden and ready to go, but then I got hit with this:

I was crushed. Well not really, but I was a little discouraged.

# Alternatives
After that bombshell I decided to start looking for alternatives to UpWork. Luckily I already had a couple in mind:

## [Freelancer][freelancer]
Freelancer is very similar to UpWork in terms of how you find work. It has the same marketplace-esque look where freelancers can pick and choose the jobs they want based on their skills. Freelancer did not require any sort of previous work for me to show to get started so it seemed like a dream. The issue with letting just anyone become a freelancer is that you end up with a saturated market where there are people willing to work for pennies at a time, thus driving down overall wages. After about an hour of looking at jobs I felt as if I couldn't compete so I decided to move on.

## [Fiverr][fiverr]
I personally think that Fiverr as an idea is quite interesting. Basically on Fiverr the clients come to you. You can create "gigs" that basically describe what it is you will do for a client. If a client likes what they see, they can select your gig and look at the prices that you offer. In terms of pricing Fiverr is quite similar to Freelancer. In respect to "real world" prices, Fiverr prices are low, and they are offering a pretty large amount of work. Since I'm still beginning it would be difficult for me to break into that market and offer the same quality (and/or quality).

## Searching Locally
Another option would be traditional cold calls, but I'm not really sure if that's the correct word for this kind of work. I'd just be contacting people that I suspect need a website. To start this process I immediately hopped on Google Maps and started looking around my area for small shops that either have no website or need a redesign. This first part turned up with some good results, but I was overwhelemed with the amount of work that would have to go into redesigning some of these sites. For a first client I wanted something simple that wouldn't take too long, and that I could show off. Long story short I got cold feet and couldn't get myself to actually message these shops.

## Twitter
I had recently been talking to people on a programming Discord server asking an embarrassing number of questions about freelancing, and someone gave me [this wonderful link to a Shopify article][shopify-article] pretty much explaining everything I will need for the simple stage that I am at right now. The article mentioned using Twitter's amazing search bar to find clients. At first I really doubted that twitter could help at all, but I was quickly proven wrong. I went to twitter and I made a simple search of "I need a website". When you first make a search like that Twitter shows you the most popular posts containing your search query. From there you can see that each post containing "I need a website" has several comments from web developers and designers asking to make the website for them. While this was helpful it wasn't exactly what I was looking for. I had to switch to the "Latest" tab so I could get the fresh posts that other developers haven't seen yet.

When I first opened the latest tab there were nothing but bots posting entries from Freelancer with people who needed websites. I should mention that I was at the library doing work at this time and I wasn't planning on taking on any clients because I was still kind of nervous and wary of my skills. I told myself that I would keep the Twitter tab open just to see how often people make twitter posts about needing websites. After about an hour of doing work I decided to check twitter and that's when I saw a woman who needed a website for her Eyelash Extension business. Now I had told myself that I wasn't going to be taking any clients but I couldn't help myself and ended up replying to her tweet asking about what kind of website she needed. She said that she needed a simple one page site. That's when I realized that this was the perfect project for me. It was exactly what I needed to get this career off the ground!

# My First Client (almost)
After talking for a bit directly on her timeline I decided to make my move and ask if we could move to the DM's because for some reason that seemed more professional. I told her up front that I wouldn't be working for free, and this was just because I didn't want to get further into negotiations and realize that she wasn't expecting to pay for anything. She said she knew it would cost money so that was a relief. I decided to start with my rates, and I'll be honest I don't know if that was a good or bad move. At the time I felt as if it was a good move because that way we could decide upfront and not have to worry about it at the end.

The most nerve racking part of all this was when she asked for my rates. Now I don't want to give out what I charged because I personally think that it was embarrassingly low. But to give you an idea, I told her I'd charge her once for the site, and $20/month for hosting and maintenance fees. My thinking here was that I would have a [reseller hosting account][reseller] which generally cost $15-$30/month. I was okay with charging her $20/month because the reseller hosting plan that I was going with would cost me $15/month so I'd be immediately covering those costs, and eventually whenever I got another client, I'd be good to go.

So after I told her my rates, the wait between then and her reply seemed like forever, but eventually she said yes! I was so excited to finally get started and have something to show for myself, but that's when she asked me something that I knew couldn't end well. Her words were "Where are you located?". I am going to make a website for her, so a us being a far away from each other shouldn't matter right? RIGHT? Well unfortunately it did for us. She was looking for someone more local to where she lived. I'll admit, I was bummed out by that news, but I didn't want to pry and ask why it would matter, but I wanted to seem professional, so I just left her with "That's unfortunate. If you cannot find someone local, I'd be happy to work with you". I have good hopes for that because if she cannot find someone local I think she'd come to me because I don't think anyone else that offers would be offering for such a low price. So silver lining right?


# Moving Forward
Even though that entire situation discouraged me quite a bit I am glad that I made it that far. It felt good to actually have a client, even if it was only for a couple of minutes. I decided to ride that wave of accomplishment and email one of the local businesses near me. I haven't gotten a reply yet, but that's okay because now that I've had a semi-client and have emailed a potential client, I feel more confident to get in contact with more clients. I'm making progress. It's slow, but it's still progress. Hopefully the next post I'm writing is telling you all about my first website, but until then, believe in yourself and stay confident.
