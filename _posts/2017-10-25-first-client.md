# It Finally Happened!

After hours and hours of looking for businesses on google maps and contacting them I finally got a response that panned out! All of my emails generally follow the same pattern:

Hello,

My name is Nicholas Morris and I am a web developer and designer. I have been looking at local and semi-local businesses that have websites that need a redesign, and I noticed your site, and I think that your site could use a new look. **[Insert Case Here]**

---

## Case 1: Mobile Responsiveness

In the event that the website lacks mobile responsiveness, or any responsiveness at all, I bring it up and mention how it affects their business and possibly leads to a loss of potential clients. In these cases the site often has a overall "good enough" design, so I often say how I like the overall feel of the site. I do this because I don't want them to think that I think their site is very bad, because I have no way of knowing if they like their site or not.

## Case 2: Overall Bad Design

In the event that the website actually has a bad design, I still go with the "I like the overall feel", for the same reason as above. I also talk about a "weak online presence", and how I'd like to improve their online presence in order to bring in more clients

# My Client

Ironically enough the client that responded didn't fit into the two cases. He had a site that he was working on in Wordpress and the design for the site was fine. It was just empty. So in the email I used the "online presence" part from Case 2, and said that if I was a customer I'd be turned away from the site because of the lack of information. I feel that one of the most important part of these emails is to show business owners how a new website would improve their business. If they can be convinced that your new design will bring in more business, and they can afford to pay you, it only seems logical to get a new design.

I had talked to other potential clients before over email, but he did something unexpected, and told me to call him. All previous contact with clients has been done over the internet, whether that was through Twitter or email, so this surprised me. I called him and we talked about what I can do and then he asked me the dreaded question: "How much will you charge for this". Normally when I get this question I have time to think about it because of the nature of communicating online, but in this situation I had maybe five seconds to respond. I gave out a range larger than anything I'd ever charged. To my surprise he agreed! In the grand scheme of things, the price I charged was small, but that's okay for two reasons. One, I couldn't justify charging much more because of my lack of experience, and two, for my first client ever, I was okay with the range we agreed on.

After talking to some people on Discord, the general consensus about freelance web dev work was to not work for anything less than $40/hr. Based on the range I gave, I am definitely under that, but for now that's fine. I can now confidently charge higher prices.

I've been trying to stay away from restaurants because I don't know how to implement any online ordering service that they may want, but in this case, the restaurant handles orders through GrubHub, so that made things easier for me. He recently bought a banner for a new location, and it has the website link on it, so he wanted me to make a temporary site quickly, and would pay extra for that. It took about three days and overall I think it looks good. I'll definitely bemaking some much needed changes to the final version. Here is a picture of part of the site:

It's mobile responsive, but a lot of work needs to be done with the mobile page.

# Moving Forward

I had was talking to a potential client a day or two before I met my current client, and she wanted a simple site to host her art. We were talking and then she disappeared for a day or two. I was confused and falsely made the assumption that we were done talking, so I moved on and eventually found my current client. She messaged me while I was talking with my current client and I panicked because I didn't think I could juggle the two at the same time just yet. I asked her if I could put her on hold, fully expecting her to no longer do business with me, but she was understanding, so that worked out. I feel as if that could have ended up a lot worse. I've decided to work with both at the same time and will be messaging her later today. Such her site isn't anything too complicated I should be fine. I still have a ton to learn about the freelancing world, but I'm making progress. It's insanely slow, but I am totally okay with the current pace. Thanks for reading, and I hope to see you next time!
