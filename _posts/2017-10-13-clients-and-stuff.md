### Before we get started
This is a rather long post and I didn't document the process, so you'll have to wait until the end of the post to see the final product. That, or you could just [click here](#final). I'd recommend reading the post though!

# I Did It! Kinda..
After my [crushing defeat][last-post] in my last post I said "Hopefully the next post I'm writing is telling you all about my first website", and I'm glad to say that I actually did it, but there are strings attached. While I did find some work, I feel as if I broke a golden rule of freelancing. __Never work for free__. Well guess what, I may have done some work for free. This is something that I've heard time and time again across several sites and in several places. The underlying concern about working for free is that it sets a dangerous precedent that if you did work once for free, you are expected to do more for free. I wholeheartedly agree with that, but I feel as if my situation may be a little different. Let me exaplain.

# Joining A Business
There is a programming discord server where I hang out at pretty frequently. Last Friday or so I saw that someone was starting some sort of business and shared some social media links. Curious, decided to click the link to his Twitter page, and that's where I saw the link to his website. Being the web designer that I am was curious as to how good the site is, and wondering if I could do a better site. The site itself wasn't much, as the business was just starting up. It was simply a "coming soon" page with the name of the business, and some social media links. It didn't look bad, it was just kind of boring, and I figured that if you want people to be excited for your upcoming business, you should try and make your "coming soon" page more exciting. This led me to ask Jelani, the creator, if I could redesign his site. He said he would not be able to pay me, but I could do it if I'd like. This is where I heard the voices in the back of my head yelling at me no to take the job. It was such a small job that I figured that it would not hurt me in the long run. I still stand strong on that opinion. I completely understand the dangers of working for free, but the thing is, I genuinely like design. It is a true passion that I have. Working on designs by myself is fun on its own, but having an objective to work towards is so much nicer. I tried my best to mitigate the part of working free where you're seen as free labor by telling Jelani that if his business started to take off I could design him a real website, but not for free. If I make my intentions clear, that I'm not free labor, I'm in the clear right? I guess we'll just have to wait and see.

# Getting To Work
I wasn't given too much to work with so I essentially had a blank canvas. What I was given was a logo and a name. The name, "BaconLabs". There is a reason for the name, but I don't want to give too many details about the business, so I'll leave it at that. Unfortunately I didn't document my progress because at the time I wasn't even thinking about the possibility of writing about it. I really wish that I did though because the design went through several iterations. To begin I did a quick Google search for "Stylish landing page". I came across some good looking ones, but a lot of them looked exactly the same. I didn't want something extravagant, btu I wanted something memorable. What kind of designer would I be if I just made web pages that looked like a majority of others. 

# Inspiration
The first design that caught my eye was the landing page of Facebook's, [now shut down][paper] newspaper app, Paper:

![Paper](https://preview.ibb.co/fmWgVb/11_landing.jpg)


What I loved most about this design was the simplicity and clean feel. I felt that a design like this would be good because of the small amount of information I had. The next one that caught my eye was the landing page for a product named Tymeline. As far as I can tell, this product or company no longer exists:

![Tymeline](https://preview.ibb.co/mtaYAb/03_landing.jpg)

This one interested me for essentially the same reasons. I did like the two color split idea though. I played around with that for a bit, but I just couldn't get the same feeling. Shortly after finding those two examples I came across [this article][article] which had those two designs, and also some other good ones that followed the same basic theme of simplicity. With these examples in mind, an idea that I actually liked started to form in my head. It was time to seriously get to work!

# Putting Pen To Paper, But Not Really
I liked the idea of some sort of background that evoked a sense of organization or productivity. Luckily for me, in the files that were given to me, there was a picture of a nice desk space. I played around with some effects to have the desk space visible, but not the center of attention. From what I've read and heard from other designers is that if you're going to have an image in the background you can try putting a "film" over the background and have text over it to distinguish the background from the text. You can get the same effect by giving the background a slight blur. With that in mind, I gave the background a blur and added a slightly translucent white container over top of it. I liked how that looked so I stuck with it. 

# Finishing Up

Since there wouldn't be much else on the page this really set the mood. Next was to add the logo, an input box for users to input their emails, and some social media links. As of now, any web project that has icons is using a nice svg icon pack called [feather icons][feather]. These are simply beuatiful icons that are easy to add to my project and easy to work with, so as tradition I went wit the simple feather icons for the social media links. 

Fonts have forever been a mystery to me and I can rarely decide on a font that looks good and compliments the page. Luckily this time a font was already given to me, so I didn't have to spend forever working on that. All that was left was to make it mobile responsive. Even thought there wasn't much on the page, I needed to make it mobile responsive. I didn't want a potential client of the business to visit the site on a mobile device and see the business as unprofesional because of the lack of mobile responsiveness. With such a small amount of conent, surely making it mobile responsive would take no time at all right? I don't know if I was just doing something wrong, but this took way longer than I expected. Every time I start a project I forget that the last 10% of the project never fails to take the most amount of time. As always this was true, but after roughly 3-4 hours of work I finally got it to look good on a majority of devices (phones, tablets, small computers).

# Final Product {#final}

Overall, I like how it turned out and for the most part I'm glad I took the job. It's not much, but it is mine. The feeling of their being a website on the web that I made that doesn't belong to me is a great one. This feeling alone can and will drive me to continue honing my craft and taking on more clients. And for those of you who have been dying to know what it looks like, here it is:

![final-product](https://preview.ibb.co/ddo6Dw/screenshot.png)

I understand that this isn't exactly the ideal way to tell a development story. I left a lot to the imagination. Next time I work on something I'll be sure to take frequent pictures of my progress so I have more to show than just the final product. I also feel like some people would be interested in my creative process.

# Moving Forward

While this was a rather short experience, I feel like I learned a lot. I learned more about my design process, and also what it's like to work with a client. This client was a little more formal than how other in the future may be, but I still think this was a learning experience. As always I will continue looking for work, but I like to think about the possibility of this business getting bigger. Because I was the one to design this page, I feel as if I could be the first person they look at for a fresh new design. A boy can dream! I've been doing a lot of reading on [Medium][medium] and I've come across a lot of people saying to make sure you network as a freelancer. I'm not pointing this out because I didn't already know this, but because I feel like this is a big step. There are now people out there that know that I can design, and from the feedback of the client, they know that I can design well. Who knows, maybe this will lead to more opportunities. I suppose we can only wait and see.

# About This Blog
I want to take a brief moment to talk about the state of this blog. At the moment I don't really have an upload schedule. I really only upload when something significant happens, and while that seems reasonable, I feel as if I should be making more updates. The posts that I have uploaded so far have been pretty long in length, and while I may feel some sort of personal achievement for that, not everyone wants to read through the entire post in one sitting. So in order to retain viewer attention I think I will try to post at least once a week. I was inspired about a story from the podcast [Side Hustle School][side-hustle], which I learned about from a friend. The host was telling a story of a man who started a finance blog in college, and he was uploading three times a week! I suddenly felt pretty lousy about my weird schedule, so I've decided to be more organized about this. For now it will just be once a week. At the moment I don't have anything on Wednesdays so I suppose that Wednesday will be my upload day (may or may not start this Wednesday). If I feel comfortable with that I may start uploading twice a week. Because of the nature of my work I don't know if I could pull off three posts a week, but we'll see. Until then, thank you so much for reading! If you have any questions or comments feel free to reach out to me on Twitter[@Nickels_7][twitter] or email! I don't really have any way of knowing if people like this blog at the moment, so a personal message would go a long way. See you next time!
